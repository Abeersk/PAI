# Glossary: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This glossary contains all technical terms used in the textbook with IEEE Robotics & Automation Society vocabulary.

## A

**Actuator** - A component that converts control signals into physical motion. In humanoid robotics, actuators typically control joint movement.

**APA 7** - American Psychological Association 7th edition citation format required for academic references.

**API** - Application Programming Interface; defines how software components should interact.

## B

**Behavior Tree** - A hierarchical structure used for organizing complex behaviors in robotics, consisting of control flow nodes and execution nodes.

**Bipedal** - Having two legs; refers to walking on two legs like humans.

## C

**Centroidal Dynamics** - The study of the relationship between forces applied to a robot and the motion of its center of mass.

**Control Loop** - A feedback mechanism that continuously adjusts system behavior based on error between desired and actual states.

**CPG** - Central Pattern Generator; a neural network that produces rhythmic outputs without rhythmic inputs, used in locomotion control.

## D

**DH Parameters** - Denavit-Hartenberg parameters; four parameters (θ, d, a, α) that define the relative position and orientation of two consecutive joints in a robotic manipulator.

**DOF** - Degrees of Freedom; the number of independent movements a mechanical system can make.

**Dynamics** - The study of forces and torques that cause motion in robotic systems.

## E

**End-effector** - The device at the end of a robotic arm designed to interact with the environment.

## F

**FK** - Forward Kinematics; the process of determining the position and orientation of the end-effector given the joint angles.

**Figure-Eight Gait** - A walking pattern where the foot traces a figure-eight path during the swing phase.

## G

**Gait** - The pattern of movement of the limbs during locomotion.

**Gait Phase** - The different stages of a walking cycle, typically divided into stance phase and swing phase.

## H

**Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)** - A testing method that involves physical components in a simulated environment.

## I

**IK** - Inverse Kinematics; the process of determining joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation.

**IMU** - Inertial Measurement Unit; a device that measures and reports on the force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the device.

## J

**Jacobian** - A matrix that describes the relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities in robotics.

**Joint Space** - The space defined by the joint angles of a robot.

## K

**Kinematics** - The study of motion without considering the forces that cause it.

## L

**Locomotion** - The ability to move from one place to another.

**Lyapunov Function** - A scalar function used in stability analysis of dynamical systems.

## M

**MPC** - Model Predictive Control; an advanced control method that uses a model of the system to predict future behavior.

## P

**PID Controller** - A control loop feedback mechanism that calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable.

**Pseudoinverse** - A generalization of the inverse matrix for non-square matrices, commonly used in inverse kinematics.

## R

**Real-time** - A system that must respond to inputs within a specified time constraint.

**Reference Frame** - A coordinate system used to represent and measure the position and orientation of objects.

**ROS** - Robot Operating System; a flexible framework for writing robot software.

## S

**Safety Zone** - An area around a robot where human presence is restricted for safety reasons.

**Sensing** - The process of acquiring information about the environment and robot state through sensors.

**Singularity** - A configuration of a robot where it loses one or more degrees of freedom.

**Stability** - The property of a system to return to its equilibrium state after a disturbance.

## T

**Task Space** - The space defined by the position and orientation of the end-effector.

**Trajectory Planning** - The process of creating a path that a robot will follow through space as a function of time.

**Torque Control** - A control method that directly controls the amount of torque applied by a motor.

## V

**Velocity Control** - A control method that controls the speed of robot movement.

## W

**Whole-Body Control** - A control approach that considers the entire robot as a single system rather than controlling individual joints independently.

## Z

**ZMP** - Zero Moment Point; a criterion for dynamic stability in bipedal locomotion where the sum of moments about the point is zero.
